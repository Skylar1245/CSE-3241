## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder containing all java files
    - `data`: the folder containing all csv files to populate an empty database to our schema
    - `sql `: the folder containing sql code to create the database to our schema
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
